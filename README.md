### Election-Audit Summary: 
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election.

My proposal to the election commission or others interested in using this Election Audit is as follows:
* There are areas of improvement that could provide further information for the organization. My advice for other elections is that they look into analyzing either cities' elections or even districts to have a better understanding of the political values of certain areas that could give a clearer understanding of how the political votes will go across the state.

* The second piece of advice I would give to improve the script would be to add a column to the dataset that could be used to store the number of registered voters in each area of interest. I believe that although having the vote count is important being able to compare the vote count to the number of registered voters could give a deep understanding of the number of votes missing and comparing potential votes by area. Along with a column for age range to see if a certain age group will dictate the popular vote
